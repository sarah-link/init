# Overview

Welcome to RollInit! 

RollInit is a simple Dungeons & Dragons initiative tracker for in-person play and online campaigns that don't use a virtual tabletop. RollInit's goal is to be as simple as possible, allowing for users to quickly jump into an encounter and roll initiative with minimal setup. It can be used to roll initiative, track HP, and keep track of monster stats, or it can simply act as a turn order tracker with no extra bells and whistles.

RollInit is built on the **PERN** stack:
* React
* PostgreSQL
* Node.js with Express
